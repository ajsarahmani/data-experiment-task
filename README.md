# Introduction

A/B test is a sort of online controlled experiment with two variants  (A/B – control and alternative groups) used extensively for advertising campaign optimizations. It is a hypothesis test aiming at confirming the statistical significance of the difference in results between the two groups.

**Goal**: Analysis of test results.

**Instructions:**

- Our test has the following ID: yrYnhIfsSNiRlMa7BQIG2g
- The control group has been labeled with ‘experimentID.0’, while the alternative group has been labeled with ‘experimentID.1’.
- Goal of the experiment was to increase the number of the following events: “sign_up” and “purchase”.
- Use SQL (any dialect) / R / Python for your analysis, and try to leave important comments in your code.
- Make visuals that will be included in your pdf slide deck. For this purpose you can use any free data visualization software solution, like Tableau Public or Google Looker.

**Deliverables:**

- A pdf slide deck (<10 slides) detailing your strategic recommendations for our advertisers. It should be self-sufficient, i.e. must be understandable by the reader without any further comments.
- A SQL / R / Python code with comments.
- A chosen data visualization tool file with visuals used in your presentation.

**Rules:**

We understand your time is precious and would not want you to spend more than **6 to 8 hours** on this over the span of **one week max**.

**Evaluation:**

Please send an email with your repository solution.

It will be assessed based on:

- Your ability to distill strategic recommendations from a data set
- Your ability to communicate insights in a clear and effective way to a target audience

# Introduction

A/B test is a sort of online controlled experiment with two variants  (A/B – control and alternative groups) used extensively for advertising campaign optimizations. It is a hypothesis test aiming at confirming the statistical significance of the difference in results between the two groups.

**Goal*: Analysis of test results

## Instructions

Our test has the following ID: yrYnhIfsSNiRlMa7BQIG2g

The control group has been labeled with `experimentID.0`, while the alternative group has been labeled with `experimentID.1`.

Goal of the experiment was to increase the number of the following events: “sign_up” and “purchase”.

Use Python/R for your analysis, and try to leave important comments in your code.

## Deliverables

A pdf slide deck (<10 slides) detailing your strategic recommendations for our advertisers. It should be self-sufficient, i.e. must be understandable by the reader without any further comments.

A runnable jupyter-notebook containing all figures that appear in your presentation.

## Rules

We understand your time is precious and would not want you to spend more than **6 to 8 hours** on this over the span of **one week max**. The outcome should be runnable locally on MacOS.
